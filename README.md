This project explored Disney movie data, then built a linear regression model to predict box office success.

Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, I analyzed data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. And I performed hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.
I manipulated data using pandas and made basic plots using Seaborn.Statistical inference and two-sample bootstrap hypothesis tests for difference of means were also used in this project.

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the Disney Character Success dataset fromÂ Kelly Garrett.
